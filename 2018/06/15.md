## [Why your programmers just want to code – Hacker Noon](https://hackernoon.com/why-your-programmers-just-want-to-code-36da9973388e)

> How you handle ideas from new programmers sends an important signal. Good or bad, it sets the stage for what they expect. This determines if they share more ideas in the future… or keep their mouth shut.

> Feedback about ideas shapes behavior
> It’s only natural, then, that your programmer is reduced to doing only what brings him success: coding.
> His enthusiasm for creation, innovation, and development, sadly, are lost.

> Worse of all, though, his concern that “We aren’t building the right thing” will be replaced with “We aren’t building the thing right.”

> What is your real culture?
> Culture isn’t the slogan on your wall, or how you describe your mission during an interview. Culture is the way people actually act, and what they actually care about.
